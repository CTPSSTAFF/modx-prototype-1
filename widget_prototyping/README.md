## widget_prottyping

This directory contains notebooks to prototype use of ipywidgets widgets and the ipyfilechooser FileChooser widget.

__NOTE:__ In order for these widgets to work (i.e., render and provide advertised functionality), the widget packages must
have been installed in the relevant Anaconda environment, and they must be enabled.
The former is the responsibility of the developer who created the environment.
The latter is accomplished by executing the following
command before the _jupyter notebook_ command:
```
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
```
