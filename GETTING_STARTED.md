# Getting Started with MoDX

This document is a "Getting Started Guide" for MoDX. It walks new users through all the steps required to install and run MoDX, including:
* Installing Anaconda Navigator
* Creating an appropriately-configured Anaconda Environment in which to run MoDX Jupyter notebooks
* Launching MoDX Jupyter notebooks
* and more.

## Introduction 

The CTPS Travel Demand Model Data Explorer (a.k.a. __MoDX__) is a colleciton of [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks that allow users without access to a TransCAD machine
and a TransCAD software license to view the inputs to and outputs from CTPS's Travel Demand Model, generate reports, graphs, and maps from this data,
and otherwise have a jolly good time frolicking in what otherwise might seem to be tens of gigabytes of unintelligible gibberish. (A Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web
application that allows user to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.) The code in MoDX Jupyter notebooks is
written in the [Python](https://python.org) programming language, and makes use of many "packages" in addition to those included in the Python Standard Library.
These packages provide support for working with files in [OMX](https://github.com/osPlanning/omx/wiki/Specification) matrix format,
efficiently executing numerical calcutions on large quantities of data, working with tabular and spatial datain "data frames", 
and generating static and interactive graphs, plots, and maps.  

Because of the many packages required by MoDX, and the subtle dependencies among them, Anaconda is used to build and maintain a consistent set of these packages
that are known to work together. Without such a tool, maintaining a consistent set of packages among the many and varied users of ModDX would become an enormous
resource drain, not to mention headache. Consequently, getting started with MoDX first entails installing Anaconda, and creating a correct environment in which
to run MoDX Jupyter notebooks.
